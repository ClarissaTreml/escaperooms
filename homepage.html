            of our themes for everyone!</p><br>

            <h1>Q&A</h1>
            <br><h2> 1. ARE WE REALLY LOCKED IN THE ROOM?</h2><br>
            No! All our escape rooms are equipped with emergency exit buttons.
            If you need to excuse yourself to the bathroom or need to leave the room,
            you should radio the Game Master to let them know your intentions, so they can respond accordingly.<br>


            <br><h2>2. ARE YOUR ESCAPE ROOMS SCARY?</h2><br>
            Our escape rooms are intended to be spooky.
            Our rooms are designed to be immersive,
            suspenseful and challenging, but our intention is never to purposely scare you.
            Don’t worry you won’t spend an hour bumping around in pitch darkness!<br>

            <br><h2>3. ARE THE ESCAPE ROOMS CLAUSTROPHOBIC?</h2><br>
            Spoiler alert! Our escape rooms are not really locked nor are the rooms very small.
            In case of an emergency, there is a button you can press to exit the game. We have
            designed our escape rooms to be a place for players to have fun with friends, family,
            and co-workers giving them an immersive storyline to focus on. We have also carefully
            determined player maximums for each game to make sure that everyone will have plenty
            of room at each point during the experience.<br>

            <br><h2>4. DO WE HAVE TO PLAY WITH STRANGERS?</h2><br>
            All our escape games are private experiences. You will not be paired up with strangers.
            Once you book an escape room it is reserved exclusively for you and your teammates—unless,
            of course, you’d like to invite some new friends!<br>

            <br><h2>5. IS THERE A DRESS CODE?</h2><br>
            There is no strict dress code to play our escape rooms, but you should dress for comfort
            and for movement.<br>

            <br><h2>6. HOW MANY ROOMS ARE THERE IN EACH GAME?</h2><br>
            Part of the adventure is to discover this with your team mates—so, sorry, you’ll have
            to play each of the themes to find out.<br>

            <br><h2>7. WHAT CAN I BRING INTO THE ESCAPE ROOM?</h2><br>
            All you need is your favourite teammates, your inner detective and puzzle solving skills!
            If you wear reading glasses be sure to bring them as well!
            We provide lockers free of charge for storing phones, cameras, purses, etc.
            (Sorry, no recording devices are allowed in our theme rooms.)<br>

            <br><h2>8. ARE YOUR ESCAPE ROOMS PHYSICALLY DEMANDING?</h2><br>
            Our escape games are designed for you to use your wits, and not meant to be physically demanding!
            Although you should dress for movement, our indoor escape games do not require running,
            jumping, or any physical strength. However, you may need to bend over or lift small things
            in order to escape. No force is required for any of our puzzles, just mental strength!<br>

            <br><h2>9. WHAT ARE THE DIFFICULTLY LEVELS OF YOUR ROOMS?</h2><br>
            All of our themes are designed to have the same level of difficulty, and are meant to be
            extremely challenging. Each theme consists of different styles of puzzles, in order to challenge
            all of your mental faculties.  Of course, the puzzles among our various themes are all different,
            and whether players find some puzzles easier or more challenging to solve is unique to each individual.<br>
